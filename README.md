This is the code repository for the first edition of Introduction to Data Science.

**This repository is now out-of-date**. We recommend using the second edition which is now divided in two parts:

* Introduction to Data Science [[Web page](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook-part-1)|[Repository](https://github.com/rafalab/dsbook-part-1)]
* Advanced Data Science [[Web page](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook-part-2)|[Repository](https://github.com/rafalab/dsbook-part-2)]

The book web page for the [first edition](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/) 
and a [PDF version](https://leanpub.com/datasciencebook) are still available.
